## ðŸ’¡ Why I Built This

I created this project to learn and practice real-world app development with Flutter.  
The goal was to understand the full user journey:

- From **sign-up with email**
- To **OTP confirmation**
- Through **profile creation**
- And eventually **profile updates** stored in Firestore.

This project helped me connect backend logic with UI, write reusable code, and manage app state cleanly.
